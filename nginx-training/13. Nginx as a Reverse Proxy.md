## Nginx : Introduction to Reverse Proxy and configuration

### Introduction

In this section, we will learn how to configure Nginx as a reverse proxy. We will also learn how to configure Nginx as a load balancer.

### Reverse Proxy

`Reverse proxy` is a type of proxy server that retrieves resources on behalf of a client from one or more servers. These resources are then returned to the client as if they originated from the proxy server itself. It is also known as a web proxy server. 

Reverse proxy is a server that sits in front of one or more web servers intercepting requests from clients and forwardes it to those websevers. It is used to distribute the load among several servers.

Reverse proxies are typically implemented to help increase `security`, `performance`, and `reliability`.

- It is used to distribute the load among several servers.
- It is used to hide the identity of the server.
- It is used to filter requests.
- It is used to improve performance.
- It is used to implement security policies.
- It is used to cache static content`

#### Benefits of Reverse Proxy

- It is used to distribute the load among several servers.
`Load Balancing` - It is used to distribute the load among several servers. A popular website may receive a large number of requests from users. A reverse proxy can distribute the load among several servers to improve performance.
Example : A popular website that gets millions of users every day may not be abble to handle all of its incoming site traffic with a single origin server. Instead, the site can be distributed among a pool of different servers, handling requests of the same site. A reverse proxy can distribute the load among several servers to improve performance.

- A reverse proxy can provide a load balancing solution which will distribute the incoming traffic evenly among a pool of servers (the different servers) to prevent any single server from overloaded. This will help to improve the performance of the servers.

- `Protection from attacks` - With a reverse proxy in place, a website or service never needs to reveal its origin IP address to the public of their origin server(s). This can help to protect the server from attacks. It majes it more harder for attakers to leverage a DDoS attack against the origin server(s) (a tartgeted attack again the sever), CDN (Content Delivery Network) or other services.

- `Caching` - A reverse proxy can cache static content such as images, CSS, and JavaScript files. This can help to improve the performance of the website or service.

- `SSL Termination` - A reverse proxy can terminate SSL connections from clients and establish new SSL connections to backend servers. This can help to reduce the load on the backend servers.
Encryting and decrypting communications for each client can be computationally intensive. A reverse proxy can be configure to decrypt all incoming  requests and encrypt all outgoing responses, freeing up resources on the backend servers.
    - This can help to reduce the load on the backend servers.
    - SSL traffic is computationally intensive. Reverse proxy can handle this on behalf of the backend servers.


## Configure Nginx as a Reverse Proxy

### We are going to setup two more servers to demonstrate how to configure Nginx as a reverse proxy.

- `web1` - server 1
- `web2` - server 2
- `nginx-proxy-server` - reverse proxy server



Installtion Nginx on `web1` and `web2` servers.


```bash
sudo apt update # apt stands for Advanced Packaging Tool
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt-get update # apt-get is a command line tool for handling packages and updates in Ubuntu
sudo apt install nginx

sudo apt-get -y install nginx # -y flag will assume yes as answer to all prompts and run non-interactively

# install net-tools
sudo apt-get install net-tools

# check nginx status
ps aux | grep nginx
sudo systemctl status nginx
```


Let's now modify the default Nginx configuration file for nginx-proxy-server.

```bash
#config file: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
sudo vi /etc/nginx/nginx.conf


#basic conf file
user www-data;
worker_processes auto;
pid /run/nginx.pid;
include /etc/nginx/modules-enabled/*.conf;

events {
        worker_connections 768;
        # multi_accept on;
}

http {

        tcp_nopush on;
        tcp_nodelay on;
        keepalive_timeout 65;
        types_hash_max_size 2048;

        include /etc/nginx/mime.types;
        default_type application/octet-stream;

        access_log /var/log/nginx/access.log;
        error_log /var/log/nginx/error.log;
        include /etc/nginx/conf.d/*.conf;
        include /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/*;
   }

}

# cd /etc/nginx

# test nginx configuration
sudo nginx -t


# reload nginx
sudo nginx -s reload
```

Add the following configuration to the default Nginx configuration file for nginx-proxy-server.

```bash
#config file: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
sudo vi /etc/nginx/nginx.conf

# add the new server block/context
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name 192.168.210.10;
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://192.168.200.10;
}
```

```bash
# Full config file
user www-data;
worker_processes auto;
pid /run/nginx.pid;
include /etc/nginx/modules-enabled/*.conf;

events {
        worker_connections 768;
        # multi_accept on;
}

http {

        tcp_nopush on;
        tcp_nodelay on;
        keepalive_timeout 65;
        types_hash_max_size 2048;

        include /etc/nginx/mime.types;
        default_type application/octet-stream;

        access_log /var/log/nginx/access.log;
        error_log /var/log/nginx/error.log;
        include /etc/nginx/conf.d/*.conf;
        include /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/*;

        server {
            listen 80;
            server_name 192.168.210.10;
            location / {
                proxy_pass http://192.168.200.10;
            }
        }
}

# cd /etc/nginx

# test nginx configuration
sudo nginx -t

# reload nginx
sudo nginx -s reload


# Let's tail the logs

sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/access.log
sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/*
```


### Let's Install php-fpm on the other server - application server.

```bash
sudo apt-get install php-fpm
sudo systemctl status php7.2-fpm

# check php version 
sudo find / -name "*sock"

# result 
#vagrant@webserver-ubuntu:~$ sudo find / -name "*sock"
/lib/modules/4.15.0-210-generic/kernel/net/vmw_vsock
/lib/modules/4.15.0-211-generic/kernel/net/vmw_vsock
/dev/vhost-vsock
/run/php/php7.2-fpm.sock
/run/systemd/inaccessible/sock
/usr/src/linux-headers-4.15.0-211/tools/testing/vsock
/usr/src/linux-headers-4.15.0-211/net/vmw_vsock
/usr/src/linux-headers-4.15.0-210/tools/testing/vsock
/usr/src/linux-headers-4.15.0-210/net/vmw_vsock
/usr/src/linux-headers-4.15.0-211-generic/include/config/sock
/usr/src/linux-headers-4.15.0-210-generic/include/config/sock
/sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/sock
/sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/tcp/tcp_destroy_sock
```

Let's modify the default Nginx configuration file for the appication server.

```bash
#config file: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
sudo vi /etc/nginx/nginx.conf

# add the new server block/context
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name
    location / {
        root /var/www/html;
        index index.php index.html index.htm;
    }
    location ~ \.php$ {
        include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
        fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php/php7.2-fpm.sock;
    }
}


# Full config file
user www-data;
worker_processes auto;
pid /run/nginx.pid;
include /etc/nginx/modules-enabled/*.conf;

events {
        worker_connections 768;
        # multi_accept on;
}

http {

        tcp_nopush on;
        tcp_nodelay on;
        keepalive_timeout 65;
        types_hash_max_size 2048;

        include /etc/nginx/mime.types;
        default_type application/octet-stream;

        access_log /var/log/nginx/access.log;
        error_log /var/log/nginx/error.log;
        include /etc/nginx/conf.d/*.conf;
        include /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/*;

        # Define the server context
        server {
            listen 80;
            server_name 192.168.100.10;
            location / {
                root /var/www/html;
                index index.php index.html index.htm;
            }
            location ~ \.php$ {
                include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
                fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php/php7.2-fpm.sock;
            }
        }
}

# cd /etc/nginx

# test nginx configuration
sudo nginx -t

# reload nginx
sudo nginx -s reload
```


Cretae a php file in the application server.

```bash
# cd into nginx root directory
#cd /var/www/html
cd /usr/share/nginx/html

# create a php file
#sudo vi /var/www/html/info.php
sudo vi index.php
```

```php
<?php phpinfo(); ?>
```

```bash
# Let's tail the logs

sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/access.log
sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/*
```


### Lets define a new server block/context on the nginx-proxy-server

```bash
#config file: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
sudo vi /etc/nginx/nginx.conf

# add the new server block/context
# Full config file
user www-data;
worker_processes auto;
pid /run/nginx.pid;
include /etc/nginx/modules-enabled/*.conf;

events {
        worker_connections 768;
        # multi_accept on;
}

http {

        tcp_nopush on;
        tcp_nodelay on;
        keepalive_timeout 65;
        types_hash_max_size 2048;

        include /etc/nginx/mime.types;
        default_type application/octet-stream;

        access_log /var/log/nginx/access.log;
        error_log /var/log/nginx/error.log;
        include /etc/nginx/conf.d/*.conf;
        include /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/*;

        # Define proxy for nginx on port 80 
        server {
            listen 80;
            server_name 192.168.210.10;
            location / {
                proxy_pass http://192.168.200.10;
            }
        }

        # define prox for php on port 8080
        server {
            listen 8080;
            server_name 192.168.210.10;
            location / {
                proxy_pass http://192.168.100.10;
            }
        }
}

# cd /etc/nginx

# test nginx configuration
sudo nginx -t

# reload nginx
sudo nginx -s reload
```
