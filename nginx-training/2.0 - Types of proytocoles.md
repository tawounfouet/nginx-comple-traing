## Protocol Definition

Protocol is a digital language through which we communicate with others on the Internet. It is a set of rules that governs the communications between computers on a network. 

In order for two computers to talk to each other, they must be speaking the same language. Many different types of network protocols and standards are required to ensure that your computer (no matter which operating system, network card, or application you are using) can communicate with another computer located on the next desk or half-way around the world.

A protocol is a set of rules that governs the communication between computers on a network. These rules include guidelines that regulate the following characteristics of a network:
- access method: how a computer gains access to the data on the network
- allowed physical topologies: how the computers are physically wired together
- type of cabling: the type of cable used to carry the data
- speed of data transfer: how fast the data is transmitted
- type of network architecture: the network architecture used, such as Ethernet or Token Ring
- network models used: the network models used, such as peer-to-peer or client/server
- network access method: how a computer gains access to the data on the network
- network topologies: how the computers are physically wired together

## Types of Protocols
Each protot is defined in diferent terms and different use with unique name. Message travel from sender to receiver via a medium (network cable, wireless, etc.) using `protocol` and the medium is governed by a set of rules. These rules are called protocols. Each protocol has its own method of how data is formatted when it is sent and how it is handled when it is received.
There are many different types of protocols. Some of the most common network protocols are:
- `Ethernet` used to connect devices in a system to a local area network (LAN) - **Port 80**

## The most important protocols
### TCP/IP - Port 80
`TCP/IP`is the most commonly used protocol suite on the Internet. TCP/IP provides end-to-end connectivity, specifying how data should be formatted, addressed, transmitted, routed, and received at the destination. TCP/IP requires little central management, and it is designed to make networks reliable, with the ability to recover automatically from the failure of any device on the network.

### TCP - Port 22
`TCP` (Transmission Control Protocol) is a set of rules (protocol) used along with the Internet Protocol (IP) to send data in the form of message units between computers over the Internet. While IP takes care of handling the actual delivery of the data, TCP takes care of keeping track of the individual units of data (called packets) that a message is divided into for efficient routing through the Internet.

### IP - Port 80
`IP` (Internet Protocol) is the primary protocol in the Internet Layer of the Internet Protocol Suite, which is a set of communications protocols consisting of four abstraction layers: 
    - link layer (lowest), 
    - Internet layer, 
    - transport layer and 
    - application layer (highest). 

### UDP - Port 53
`UDP` (User Datagram Protocol) is a communications protocol that is primarily used for establishing **low-latency** and **loss-tolerating** connections between applications on the internet. It speeds up transmissions by enabling the transfer of data before an agreement is provided by the receiving party. UDP is suitable for purposes where `error checking and correction are either not necessary or are performed in the application`; UDP avoids the overhead of such processing in the protocol stack. Time-sensitive applications often use UDP because dropping packets is preferable to waiting for delayed packets, which may not be an option in a real-time system.

### HTTP - Port 80
`HTTP` (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is the protocol used to transfer hypertext pages across the Internet. HTTP defines how messages are formatted and transmitted, and what actions Web servers and browsers should take in response to various commands. For example, when you enter a URL in your browser, this actually sends an HTTP command to the Web server directing it to fetch and transmit the requested Web page.

### HTTPS - Port 443
`HTTPS` (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure) is the protocol used to transfer encrypted hypertext pages across the Internet. HTTPS is a combination of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) with SSL/TLS protocol to provide encrypted communication and secure identification of a network web server. HTTPS connections are often used for payment transactions on the World Wide Web and for sensitive transactions in corporate information systems.

### SSL - Port 443
`SSL` (Secure Sockets Layer) is a protocol developed by Netscape for transmitting private documents via the Internet. SSL uses a cryptographic system that uses two keys to encrypt data âˆ’ a public key known to everyone and a private or secret key known only to the recipient of the message. Both Netscape Navigator and Internet Explorer support SSL, and many Web sites use the protocol to obtain confidential user information, such as credit card numbers. By convention, URLs that require an SSL connection start with https: instead of http:.

### SSH - Port 22
`SSH` (Secure Shell) is a program to log into another computer over a network, to execute commands in a remote machine, and to move files from one machine to another. It provides strong authentication and secure communications over unsecured channels. It is intended as a replacement for rlogin, rsh, and rcp. For SSH to work, the remote host must have an SSH server installed, and you must have an SSH client installed.

### DNS - Port 53
`DNS` (Domain Name System) is the protocol used to resolve IP addresses to domain names. DNS servers provide domain name resolution for network resources. DNS is a distributed database that contains mappings of DNS domain names to data. DNS enables you to use friendly names to logically represent computers and services instead of IP addresses. DNS also enables you to use friendly names to locate computers and services.

### DHCP - Port 67
`DHCP` (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) is the protocol used by network devices (such as a DHCP server or router) to automatically assign IP addresses to network devices. DHCP allows a computer to join an IP-based network without having a pre-configured IP address. DHCP is a protocol that assigns unique IP addresses to devices, then releases and renews these addresses as devices leave and re-join the network. DHCP enables you to centrally manage and automate the assignment of IP addresses in a network.

### FTP - Port 21
`FTP` (File Transfer Protocol) is the protocol used to transfer files between a client and a server. FTP is a client-server protocol that relies on two communications channels between client and server: a command channel for controlling the conversation and a data channel for transmitting file content. Clients initiate conversations with servers by requesting to download a file. Using FTP, a client can upload, download, delete, rename, move, and copy files on a server.

### SMTP - Port 25
`SMTP` (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) is the protocol used to transfer electronic mail across the Internet. SMTP is a protocol for sending e-mail messages between servers. Most e-mail systems that send mail over the Internet use SMTP to send messages from one server to another. SMTP is a connection-oriented, text-based protocol in which a mail sender communicates with a mail receiver by issuing command strings and supplying necessary data over a reliable ordered data stream channel.

### POP - Port 110
`POP` (Post Office Protocol) is the protocol used to retrieve electronic mail from a mail server. POP is a protocol used by e-mail clients to retrieve e-mail from a mail server. Most e-mail applications (sometimes called an e-mail client) use the POP protocol, although some can use the newer IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol). There are two versions of POP. The first, called POP2, became a standard in the mid-80's and requires SMTP to send messages. The newer version, POP3, can be used with or without SMTP.

### IMAP - Port 143
`IMAP` (Internet Message Access Protocol) is the protocol used to retrieve electronic mail from a mail server. IMAP is a protocol used by e-mail clients to retrieve e-mail messages from a mail server over a TCP/IP connection. IMAP is a client/server protocol in which e-mail is received and held for you by your Internet server. IMAP requires continual access to the server during the time that you are working with your mail. IMAP is a newer protocol with more features than POP.
